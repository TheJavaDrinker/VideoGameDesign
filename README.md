# VideoGameDesign
A C project to create a simple shooter game. As most of the code for this game was inspired by ChatGPT, there may be bugs present in the game or it may appear unfinished. In the future, this game will be more developed and will not rely on AI-generated content.
To run this game, it will require the use of a C compiler, such as a GCC and to follow these instructions:
1. Open a text editor and copy the code into a new file.
2. Save the file with a .c extension (e.g., shooter.c).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Type the following command to compile the code:
    + *gcc shooter.c -o shooter*
    This will create an executable file called shooter in the same directory.
5. Type the following command to run the executable:
    + *./shooter*
    This will commence the game.
